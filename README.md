# 🩸 Blood Donation Web Application

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is developed as part of my **M.Sc Computer Science final year project**.  
The main aim of this application is to connect **blood donors** and **receivers (patients or hospitals)** through a simple web-based system.

This project helped me understand how frontend, backend, and database work together in a real-time application.

## 🙋 About This Project

I developed this project to gain practical knowledge in **full-stack web development**.

In this project, I worked on:
- Frontend design using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap
- Backend API development using Node.js and Express
- Database integration using MongoDB
- Connecting frontend and backend using JavaScript

This project gave me hands-on experience in building a complete working system.
